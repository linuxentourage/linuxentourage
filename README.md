Hello. I am @linuxentourage. 

As of my join date, 22/3/24, I am currently interested in learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.

What could that possibly be for? Only secret coders know what I'm attempting to learn how to do.

I am also interested in black hat hacking.

What I am currently achieving

 HTML

 
 creating github website

What I want to achieve
 
 SQL Injections
 
 DoS or DDoS Attacks
 
 Creating a server using Linux
 
 
 But the thing I aspire to complete the most is:

A Remote Administration Tool


I would love to test out Quasar, but I don't have a free computer that isn't monitored.

Thanks for reading my README.md, have a good one.
